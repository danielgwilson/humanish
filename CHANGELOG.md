# Changelog

Newest first. Each entry is the opening paragraph of that version's release notes; the link holds
the full notes. Versions not listed here (0.1.1 through 0.65.0 except 0.20.0, and 0.81.0) are
tagged without notes.

The Unreleased section holds the full notes for the next version until it is tagged.

## Unreleased

## 0.110.3: Ctrl-C at the watch prompt, review says analysis is off, E2B docs links kept (2026-10-05)

humanish 0.110.3 runs the `watch` and `observe` shutdown, and prints `watch stopped` or `observe
stopped`, when a Ctrl-C lands right at their prompt. It starts no automatic analysis for a run a
signal interrupted. `humanish review` says when a study's `review.analysis: false` is why a live
run has no findings. `humanish verify` no longer blocks a run whose text holds a URL followed by an
escaped line break and an `E2B_` variable, and redacted output keeps the E2B docs link that E2B's
401 names. The `--env-file` alias is now removed in 0.112.0. Inside, the computer-use, scripted,
terminal and shared-world routes run through one shell, `admitRoute` in `src/run/route-shell.ts`;
the live smoke ran each route on it.

## 0.110.2: Credential URLs refused, terminal key proxied, watch exits for agents (2026-10-05)

humanish 0.110.2 refuses a study URL that carries a user name, password or credential parameter,
and `humanish verify` catches all 41 secret formats its test lists, where 0.110.1 caught 13. A
terminal study that declares no `execution.runtimeAuth` keeps the OpenAI key in E2B's host-side
proxy rule (`openai-egress`) and gives Codex a placeholder. No Observer server hands out
`sandbox-receipts.ndjson` or `status.json`, and a Ctrl-C during desktop startup no longer writes
the raw sandbox id outside `sandbox-receipts.ndjson`. For a coding agent, `watch` and `observe`
print the Observer path and exit when nobody is at a terminal, a rerun of `init` rewrites only its
own `AGENTS.md` section, and suggested commands use one invocation style.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.110.2)

## 0.110.1: Claude participants restricted, sandboxes reclaimed by tag (2026-10-04)

humanish 0.110.1 starts a Claude Code participant with Read as its only tool, in a scratch folder,
with a short environment allowlist and no saved transcript, and needs Claude Code 2.1.248 or newer.
A Ctrl-C in the first seconds of a live run no longer leaves a sandbox running: every sandbox
carries the run's tags, and the signal handler and `humanish reclaim` kill what E2B lists under
them. `reclaim` reports `clean`, `unconfirmed` or `unknown`, and `humanish cleanup` is now a
deprecated alias of `reclaim --check`. run.json records how a run ended, every surface shows a
failed run as failed, and `review`, `analyze show` and a live run's last lines print the analysis
findings as text.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.110.1)

## 0.110.0: --dotenv, and sandbox ids only in receipts (2026-10-03)

humanish 0.110.0 renames `--env-file` to `--dotenv`, so a missing file reaches humanish's exit 2
result where Node exited 9 first. `--env-file` stays as a hidden alias until 0.111.0. Raw sandbox
ids live only in a run's `sandbox-receipts.ndjson`: every other record, output and export copy names
a sandbox as `[redacted-sandbox-id]` with a digest, and `humanish verify` grades a run that still
holds a raw id `local_only` with `RAW_SANDBOX_ID`. The release notes list each changed field and
what to read instead.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.110.0)

## 0.109.1: Current option names in messages, reclaim --env-file (2026-10-03)

humanish 0.109.1 is a patch. Library refusals and warnings name `RunStudyOptions`, which 0.109.0
exports, where they named the removed `RunLabOptions`. `humanish export --format bundle` no longer
copies sandbox ids into its redacted workspace. `humanish reclaim` takes `--env-file`, and
`humanish migrate` removes a `labs/` directory that its moves emptied.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.109.1)

## 0.109.0: Lab names removed, v2 study files refused (2026-10-03)

humanish 0.109.0 removes what 0.108.0 deprecated. A `humanish.lab.v2` file, or any study file in a
`labs/` directory, is refused with the command that fixes it: `humanish migrate` converts and moves
v2 files, and a v3 file in `labs/` moves to the matching `studies/` directory. The `lab` commands,
`--lab`, `serve` and `watch --run` are unknown to the CLI. The library drops its 0.107 names:
`runLab`, `parseLabConfig`, the `Lab*` types and the `Cua*` names. Run records and telemetry name
the study as `study` only, a study's result has `studyId` only, and bare `--json`, scorer contexts
and computer-use `error.name` use study and `ComputerUse` names. The release notes list each removal
and what to change.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.109.0)

## 0.108.0: Studies, one runner and one viewer, errors on stderr (2026-10-03)

humanish 0.108.0 renames labs to studies. A study file is `humanish.study.v3` under
`humanish/studies/`, and `humanish migrate` converts a `humanish.lab.v2` file, which still runs with
a warning until 0.109.0. The commands follow: `humanish study list`, `study show` and `study check`,
and `--study` in place of `--lab`. `humanish run <study>` is the one runner and `humanish observe`
the one viewer: `lab run`, `serve` and `watch --run` are hidden aliases that warn, and `--sims`,
`--lanes` and `watch --follow` are gone. Error codes and route results name the study and the
route: `HUMANISH_LAB_*` is `HUMANISH_STUDY_*`, and every route's result is
`humanish.study-result.v1`. Human-mode errors print on stderr in one shape, and `--json` output
keeps its shape. The release notes list each rename and what to change.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.108.0)

## 0.107.0: A 44-name library API, --count and --participants (2026-10-02)

humanish 0.107.0 removes the library surfaces 0.106.0 deprecated, so the entry point exports 44
names, down from 83. `runLab(config, options)` is the one way to run a lab: the route runners, the
`RunLabOptions` hook bags, `LabOutcome.backend`, the `routesTo*` predicates and `rerun.laneIds` are
gone, and a JavaScript caller that still passes a removed option is refused before anything runs.
The release notes map each removed name to its replacement. On the CLI, `--count` replaces
`--sims` and `--participants` replaces `--lanes`; the old flags work with a warning until 0.108.0.
A scripted `press` step sends its key. A signalled live run records itself as interrupted and
kills its sandboxes. Restricted Codex launches check the release's app-server schema before they
start, and a terminal lab with no declared model runs on `gpt-5.6-sol` and prices its tokens.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.107.0)

## 0.106.1: Codex CLI 0.160.0 and reclaim in E2B debug mode (2026-10-01)

Codex participants, Codex-account analysis and `humanish doctor` admit Codex CLI 0.160.0 (published
to npm 2026-10-01) on Linux x64, which 0.106.0 refused. Doctor's recovery for an unadmitted release
suggests `npm install -g @openai/codex@0.160.0`. `humanish reclaim` refuses to run with
`E2B_DEBUG=true`, where the E2B SDK reports kills it never sent, and a run's sandbox teardown in
debug mode reads unconfirmed.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.106.1)

## 0.106.0: Node 22.19, a smaller library API and stricter share safety (2026-10-01)

humanish needs Node 22.19.0 or later. The library entry point exports 83 names, down from 377:
`runLab` runs a lab, and the release notes list the 300 removed names and how to migrate. Sequential
shared-world studies, the OSS meta-lab, `run --actor` and `run --app-url` are removed, so a
shared-world lab with `execution.concurrency: 1` fails at parse. Local Codex participants run only
on the Codex CLI releases admitted for their host, and `humanish doctor` names the release it found.
`humanish verify` judges share safety by file contents. It finds secrets in base64, hex and escaped
text, and it grades a run that holds an image or archive it cannot account for `local_only`.
`serve --safe` re-verifies a run whose files changed before serving it.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.106.0)

## 0.105.0: Rich participant backgrounds (2026-09-28)

Personas now support a multiline `background` for relevant history, habits, motivations and constraints. It preserves paragraphs up to 32 KiB and rejects oversized context instead of silently truncating it. Missing files, unsupported fields and shortened legacy fields now produce diagnostics.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.105.0)

## 0.104.3: SMTP capture for local app studies (2026-09-28)

`humanish comms catch --smtp-port 1025` now supports SMTP verification mail for apps hosted by the study operator. The command previously rejected its documented SMTP option. It now validates the port and fails startup if SMTP cannot bind, instead of leaving misleading healthy HTTP status.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.104.3)

## 0.104.2: Preserve desktop capture timestamps (2026-09-28)

Desktop recordings now preserve the capture input’s microsecond timestamps and explicitly use variable-frame-rate output across local and E2B FFmpeg versions. This avoids dropping closely spaced captured frames or filling genuine gaps with duplicates. Existing recordings are unchanged.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.104.2)

## 0.104.1: Recording startup (2026-09-28)

Mixed desktop recording no longer waits behind the recording mix's default
two-second PulseAudio buffer. Its null sink now uses the supported no-rewind mode,
which bounds that buffer to 50 ms. FFmpeg settings, timestamps, startup ordering
and resource ownership are unchanged; screen-only recording uses the same path
as before.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.104.1)

## 0.104.0: Local captured inboxes (2026-09-28)

Local browser participants can now create an account, open their assigned inbox
and follow a verification link without mailbox-provider credentials. Start
`humanish comms catch`, configure the app to send email to that catch, and declare
`comms.email.external.catchBaseUrl` in the local lab. Doctor checks the catch's
recipient routes and explains setup failures before a participant starts.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.104.0)

## 0.103.2: Adjacent ending evidence for analysis (2026-09-28)

A participant can inspect a result and then scroll or navigate before ending.
Analysis now prioritizes the preceding screenshot alongside the final view,
after beginning and explicit failure context. Previously, session sampling
could omit that nearby result while retaining a final heading or navigation page.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.103.2)

## 0.103.1: Fairer analysis capture allocation (2026-09-27)

Analysis now gives reclaimed screenshot slots to eligible participants with
fewer admitted images. Previously, a participant whose images exceeded its
initial byte reservation could receive only its ending capture while other
participants received extra captures, even with enough image bytes remaining.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.103.1)

## 0.103.0: Optional desktop video and audio recording (2026-09-27)

Computer-use studies can retain an MP4 alongside screenshots, actions,
participant feedback and analysis:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.103.0)

## 0.102.0: Optional participant camera and speech (2026-09-26)

Codex participants can listen and speak while using a conferencing app. The same
continuing conversation handles browser actions and spoken replies on local
Firecracker and hosted E2B desktops. No separate conversational agent or speech
API key is required. Codex inference still uses the selected remote account.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.102.0)

## 0.101.0: Shared Codex UI tools (2026-09-25)

Codex participants now interact through a native Humanish UI tool. One continuing
Codex conversation can call the tool repeatedly, inspect each new screenshot,
and give its final feedback. Humanish executes and records the inputs, including
rejected or skipped actions, before returning their actual status to Codex.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.101.0)

## 0.100.1: Participant conversation continuity (2026-09-25)

Local Codex participants now keep one conversation for their entire study,
including closing feedback. Previously, each screenshot started a new thread
with only eight turns of summarized history. Earlier observations, actions and
participant context now remain in the Codex conversation, with Codex managing
context compaction.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.100.1)

## 0.100.0: Local study setup and startup reliability (2026-09-25)

Configure a local browser study during setup:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.100.0)

## 0.99.1: Recover from rejected browser input (2026-09-24)

A participant can now recover when the desktop explicitly rejects an action
before sending any input. For example, typing without an editable field focused
previously ended a local browser study with a harness error, even though the
browser remained usable.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.99.1)

## 0.99.0: Local browser studies on Apple Silicon Macs (2026-09-24)

Local browser studies now run on supported Apple Silicon Macs using Lima and ARM64 Firecracker desktops, with the same participants, Observer recordings and automatic analysis as Linux.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.99.0)

## 0.98.0: Local browser studies on Linux (2026-09-24)

Explicit local browser labs now run from the installed CLI and TUI. On Linux
x64 with Docker/KVM and a supported Codex ChatGPT login, isolated Firecracker
participants use the normal scheduler, recordings, Observer and automatic
analysis without E2B or OpenAI API keys. Codex inference remains remote and
consumes account quota; dollar cost is unknown.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.98.0)

## 0.97.0: Codex account reports on Linux (2026-09-23)

Saved studies can use an existing Codex ChatGPT login for their separate
findings report. Select it explicitly:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.97.0/docs/release/0.97.0-codex-account-analysis.md)

## 0.96.1: Preserve browser navigation (2026-09-20)

Hosted browser studies now measure physical client bounds with `xwininfo`.
The older `xdotool` build on hosted desktops can count window decorations twice,
incorrectly reporting that a visible browser extends beyond the captured screen.
That false reading could trigger fullscreen, hiding the tabs and address bar
participants use to move between an application and their study inbox.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.96.1/docs/release/0.96.1-browser-navigation.md)

## 0.96.0: Real email receiving (2026-09-21)

Browser studies can now receive real email through AgentMail, with a fresh inbox for each participant.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.96.0)

## 0.95.0: Connections setup (2026-09-20)

Open `humanish tui` and press **c** to configure AgentMail. **Add API key**
opens a hidden terminal prompt, then returns to Connections. Ctrl+C cancels
without changing the existing key or profile. Existing keys can be reused or
replaced. Entry uses the host's key store, outside the TUI rendering contract.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.95.0)

## 0.94.0: Reliability (2026-09-18)

Long analysis requests now honor Humanish's configured deadline instead of
ending early at the HTTP client's header timeout. The default deadline is ten
minutes. Omitted output settings use up to 32,768 tokens when the existing
declared budget admits that allowance, otherwise retaining 16,384. Explicit
output settings remain exact. This adds no retries or automatic budget increase.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.94.0/docs/release/0.94.0-reliability.md)

## 0.93.1: Observer review controls (2026-09-17)

Findings now starts with a compact overview: finding count, participants
included, analyzed outcomes, and sampled captures. The original narrative
remains under **Study summary**. Coverage notes, methodology and separate
automatic-attempt status are available under **Coverage & analysis details**.
A failed automatic attempt no longer replaces the status of a usable report.
Running or unknown execution, changed evidence, and exceeded admission limits
remain visible. Outcome counts are analysis judgments, not verified success
rates; stale reports do not use current recordings as their denominators.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.93.1/docs/release/0.93.1-observer-review-controls.md)

## 0.93.0: Global playback (2026-09-16)

The Observer uses one study clock across the participant grid and individual
recordings. Seek halfway through a study, open a participant, then scrub back:
returning to the grid shows every participant at that same time. Playback also
continues through ordinary participant navigation and browser Back/Forward.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.93.0/docs/release/0.93.0-global-playback.md)

## 0.92.0: Grid playback (2026-09-16)

Play and scrub all recorded participants together in the Observer grid.
The transport includes pause, playback speed and a shared recording timeline.
Opening a displayed capture lands on its exact frame; returning restores the
grid's time and participant page, paused.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.92.0/docs/release/0.92.0-grid-playback.md)

## 0.91.1: Study review polish (2026-09-15)

Study cost summaries include retained analysis attempts alongside participant
and desktop estimates. Reusing a saved analysis does not add another charge;
separate retries do. Missing prices and incomplete histories remain explicit.
The existing stats JSON fields keep their original participant-and-desktop
meaning; additive cost fields provide the combined retained estimate.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.91.1/docs/release/0.91.1-study-review-polish.md)

## 0.91.0: Analysis quality and defaults (2026-09-15)

Supported live studies now request analysis when the recording finishes, using
`gpt-6-astra` with high reasoning and a separate $3 admission estimate limit.
The CLI, preflight and TUI disclose that budget. Set `review.analysis: false` to
disable the extra request, or supply an analysis mapping with `maxCostUsd` to
customize it. The estimate is additional to participant and desktop costs and
is not a provider billing cap. Missing default credentials record a skip while
preserving a successful recording; explicit analysis failures remain failures.
Startup failures with no retained participant activity skip default analysis.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.91.0/docs/release/0.91.0-analysis-quality-and-defaults.md)

## 0.90.0: Findings after live studies (2026-09-14)

Labs can opt into independent analysis after their recording finishes with
`review.analysis.maxCostUsd`. The command waits for the result; the TUI and
Observer show analysis separately from participant execution and task outcomes.
Without the setting, run behavior stays unchanged.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/blob/v0.90.0/docs/release/0.90.0-automatic-analysis.md)

## 0.89.1: Finished analysis notice (2026-09-15)

Observer now labels a partial analysis result **“Analysis finished with
limitations.”** The previous notice described findings as covering evidence
“included so far,” which could make a finished analysis appear to be running.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.89.1)

## 0.89.0: Evidence-linked study findings (2026-09-14)

Completed studies can now produce ranked findings with links to the participant
events and captures that support them. Observer keeps Participants and Findings
inside the same study shell, with the recording grid, original participant
feedback and playback controls available throughout the review.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.89.0)

## 0.88.2: Sequential study model thresholds (2026-09-14)

Sequential shared-world studies now apply the model-spend thresholds they previously accepted without enforcing. The fix covers computer-use participants sharing a clone or local-tree subject with concurrency 1.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.88.2)

## 0.88.1: Completion evidence and a runnable local-app example (2026-09-12)

When a computer-use participant says it finished, Humanish now labels that completion as **participant-reported**. A recorded `stopWhen` match or completed dwell window identifies a **recorded completion condition**. Missing, malformed or conflicting detail is labeled unavailable; zero completions use **0/N recorded completions**.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.88.1)

## 0.88.0: See what ended a study (2026-09-11)

Computer-use studies now show a diagnostic category and recorded stop cause in CLI output. Fan-out results preserve each participant's ending, and newly generated review summaries use the same recorded causes. Successful dry-runs are identified as contract previews.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.88.0)

## 0.87.0: Participant endings and phone review (2026-09-10)

Humanish 0.87.0 makes participant endings easier to interpret and saved recordings easier to review on a phone.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.87.0)

## 0.86.1: Task preflight and saved recordings (2026-09-09)

Humanish now refuses a task protocol when the chosen execution path cannot run
it. Previously, a shared-world, terminal, scripted or synthetic lab could accept
`actors[0].tasks` and then omit those tasks during execution. Preflight now names
the unsupported field before creating a run or starting hooks, processes,
desktops or model requests. Remove `tasks` only when you intend a mission-only
study, or choose a supported per-lane computer-use route.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.86.1)

## 0.86.0: Participant assignments and exact action review (2026-09-09)

The Observer now shows each participant's assigned mission and lane focus.
Expand **Assigned task** in the player or participant details to read the
instructions. Computer-use runs also include their participant-facing task
goals. Hidden success checks and runtime access details stay outside this
assignment. Older recordings explicitly say when an assignment was not recorded.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.86.0)

## 0.85.1: Observer review continuity (2026-09-09)

The Observer review flow now carries the selected evidence between views:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.85.1)

## 0.85.0: Watch and review complete screens (2026-09-09)

Observer now shows portrait and desktop captures at their original proportions,
with equal-height grid previews and a compact caption below each screen. Live
labels and controls leave the captured pixels clear. A stable Info button opens
participant details, labeled Pin/Compare actions and recorded notices.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.85.0)

## 0.84.1: Run feedback checks from exported evidence (2026-09-07)

Generated feedback commands now work from a standalone exported evidence workspace:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.84.1)

## 0.84.0: Share evidence and keep readable originals (2026-09-07)

Keep readable local evidence and export a separate shareable workspace:

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.84.0)

## 0.83.2 (2026-09-07)

Concurrent computer-use studies now preserve declared reasoning effort, output-token limits and the shared actor-model budget. Host startup failures report their actual cause instead of a misleading handoff timeout. Linux browser profiles use system window decorations, with a measured fullscreen fallback for narrow desktops.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.83.2)

## 0.83.1 (2026-09-06)

Desktop CLI studies that leave product installation to the participant now prepare Node/npm before the terminal opens. Two fresh hosted desktops verified the runtime becomes available while the subject product remains uninstalled.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.83.1)

## 0.83.0 (2026-09-06)

Humanish 0.83.0 adds a per-response output limit and fixes three ways harness behavior could distort a computer-use study.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.83.0)

## 0.82.1 (2026-09-05)

Humanish 0.82.1 corrects computer-use sessions that were cut short by provider output limits. A response with no remaining actions no longer counts as successful completion when the provider explicitly says it is incomplete. Usage and partial text are preserved; actions and debrief are skipped.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.82.1)

## 0.82.0 (2026-09-05)

Humanish 0.82.0 makes repeated studies easier to reproduce and their evidence easier to interpret.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.82.0)

## 0.80.0 (2026-09-04)

v0.80.0 — the observation window on every desktop route, and a sandbox request that cannot exceed the cap

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.80.0)

## 0.79.0 (2026-09-04)

v0.79.0 — a study can hold and watch, and a participant can have a camera

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.79.0)

## 0.78.0 (2026-09-04)

v0.78.0 — the CLI no longer lingers after a run: @e2b/desktop 2.3.3, and doctor says which SDK you have

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.78.0)

## 0.77.0 (2026-09-04)

v0.77.0 — a phone participant's later tab is a phone tab too; a transient sandbox error is retried once

## 0.76.0: A phone participant at a real 414 px viewport, with touch and a mobile user agent (2026-09-03)

v0.76.0 — a phone participant at a real 414 px viewport, with touch and a mobile user agent

## 0.75.0: The task funnel measures every desktop, installs retry once, Sol priced at the live sheet (2026-09-03)

v0.75.0 — the task funnel measures every desktop, installs retry once, Sol priced at the live sheet

## 0.74.0: Run and watch write the same bundle (2026-09-01)

`humanish run` renders observer/index.html after a successful run, the way
`watch` does, so the same lab produces the same bundle whichever command
ran it. A render failure is a warning on the result, never a failed run.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.74.0)

## 0.73.0: A run bundle exports (2026-09-01)

humanish export renders the Observer for a bundle that has none, which is
every bundle `run` writes, so the everyday command's bundles can be sent.
Found by the 0.72.0 release:dogfood participant on its first export.

## 0.72.0: The cold-start Claude path works again, and is measured (2026-09-01)

The one-shot Claude participant had been failing on turn one since its
prompt sat after --allowedTools; fixed with --, kept reachable as
HUMANISH_LOCAL_AGENT_ONE_SHOT=1 for measurement, session stays the default.
Receipt: no difference on the two-table starter lab, 3 of 3 each; on a
harder mission, session 4 of 4 against one-shot 0 of 4 in 300 s and 1 of 4
in 600 s.

## 0.71.0: A taken port is named, and a lingering process can be too (2026-09-01)

A port somebody already holds reports HUMANISH_PORT_IN_USE (serve:
HUMANISH_SERVE_PORT_IN_USE) with the port and whether another humanish
process holds it, instead of HUMANISH_UNEXPECTED. HUMANISH_DEBUG_HANDLES=1
prints Node's active resources after a command settles, for the run whose
CLI lingered sixteen minutes past its result.

## 0.70.0: An export says what verify said (2026-09-01)

humanish export writes verify's share status into the file it produces
(publicSafety.share, additive and optional on the frozen observer-data
schema), and the Observer's chip renders it, so a share_ready export no
longer reads local_only.

## 0.69.0: Export, the closing line, and reports that count as friction (2026-09-01)

`humanish export --run <id>` writes one self-contained Observer with
screenshots inlined, after verify and the share gate; --local-only
watermarks. Free-text computer-use participants label their own ending
(REACHED THE GOAL. / DID NOT REACH THE GOAL. / BLOCKED.) and the trace
records it; adherence 6 of 6 on the benchmark rerun, with recall and
precision unchanged (14 of 15, 0 invented). A finished participant's report
of defects or confusion now counts as friction and becomes a feedback
candidate. drawDB precision arm: 11 of 12 claims confirmed in source.

## 0.68.0: Stats, the participant's own word, and no person profile (2026-09-01)

`humanish stats` rolls up cost, outcomes, and durations across run history
with estimates labelled and unknown costs counted as unknown. A
schema-constrained participant declares reached / not_reached / blocked on
its final turn and the lane reads that before the closing paragraph
(verified live). "blocked" no longer reads as "blocked on an approval".
Every telemetry event asks for no person profile.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.68.0)

## 0.67.0: The scan stops refusing finished runs, and a hung turn is named (2026-09-01)

Five of five completed live runs were refused as "not a credible pass" on
sentences like "I could not read the full description"; the verdict scan
now strips perception verbs after "can't" and reads "encountered no ..." as
a negation. A hung provider turn is retried once and then ends the lane as
harness_error with its name on it; a hung wait is skipped with a notice.
Claude Code participants keep one session per run. The study-participant
telemetry marker is actually set.

[Release notes](https://github.com/danielgwilson/humanish/releases/tag/v0.67.0)

## 0.66.0: The funnel tells us what a study was, and a refused lane stays refused (2026-09-01)

Telemetry now reports what a study was: mode, outcome, starter lab, brain
route, and our own error code, with ok meaning exit 0. Every event asks the
receiver not to derive a location, and the project discards client IPs.
1,359 study events before this release carried none of that.

## 0.20.0: External-public shared-world plane + CDP lobby-code handoff (2026-08-02)

Additive minor release. No breaking change to the provisioned-getHost path, its schema, or its verify
asserts (byte-stable; a snapshot regression pins it).
